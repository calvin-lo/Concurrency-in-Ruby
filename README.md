# Concurrency-in-Ruby
# Introduction
Ruby is a programming language that “balanced functional programming with imperative programming.” [1]  In this paper, we will discuss multiprocessing, multithreading, and how to achieve parallelism in Ruby.  Concurrency improves the performance of a program and take advantage of the multi core computers.  As Ruby is commonly used in web programming such as websites and web applications.  Improving the performance in Ruby program can help to improve the web performance as well.  Therefore, concurrency in Ruby is a good area to explore and discuss.  Multiprocessing and multithreading in Ruby can easily implemented by using to defined classes.  Parallel processing should have a better performance than serial processing.  We will talk about the performance on different approaches.  Additionally, we will discuss the limitation and problems when using multithreading in Ruby.  In Ruby, concurrency means multiple threads run in a overlapping time.  It includes the process of initialization, execution and completion. [2]  On the other hand, parallelism is two threads running at the same time. [2]  The difference is parallelism guaranteed the multithreading task will run simultaneously while concurrency is not necessary.  This paper will also analyze the problem and solution when implementing real parallelism in Ruby programming.
